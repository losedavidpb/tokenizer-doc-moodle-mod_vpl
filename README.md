The Virtual Programming Lab Tokenizer (VPLT) is the modern and easy way to
generate lexical analyzers for programming languages.

This repository contains the official source code of the documentation
of VPLT engine. <br> At future releases, the manual would be published
on the official VPL website.

This project has been developed to generate the VPLT documentation using
HTML format. <br>It is recommended to keep this format in order to get
the best appearance.
